# Remote Calculator

A client-server calculator application. The client sends a mathematical expression composed of integers, operators and parentheses to the server, which the server evaluates, returning the value to the client.

## Why?

I wanted to practice coding in C, and I couldn't decide between a calculator and a client-server network app. So I thought, why not both?
